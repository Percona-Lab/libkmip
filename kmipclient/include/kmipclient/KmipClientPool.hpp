   * Thread-safe pool of KmipClient connections.
   *
   * Each thread borrows a KmipClient for the duration of one or more KMIP
   * operations and then returns it automatically via RAII.  The pool creates
   * new TLS connections on demand, up to max_connections.  When all connections
   * are in use and the limit has been reached, borrow() blocks until one
   * becomes available.
   *
   * Typical usage:
   * @code
   *   KmipClientPool pool({
   *       .host = "kmip-server",
   *       .port = "5696",
   *       .client_cert = "/path/to/cert.pem",
   *       .client_key  = "/path/to/key.pem",
   *       .server_ca_cert = "/path/to/ca.pem",
   *       .timeout_ms  = 5000,
   *       .max_connections = 8
   *   });
   *
   *   // In any thread:
   *   auto conn = pool.borrow();
   *   auto id   = conn->op_create_aes_key("mykey", "mygroup");
   *   // conn is returned to the pool automatically when it goes out of scope.
   * @endcode
